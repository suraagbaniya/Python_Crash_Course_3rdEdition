'''
4-13. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods . Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple .
• Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers .
• Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the
change .
• The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods . Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu .
