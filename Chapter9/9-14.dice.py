"""
9-14. Dice: The module random contains functions that generate random num- bers in a variety of ways . The function randint() returns an integer in the range you provide . The following code returns a number between 1 and 6:
                  from random import randint
                  x = randint(1, 6)
Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default value of 6 . Write a method called roll_die() that prints a random number between 1 and the number of sides the die has . Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times .
Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die . Roll each die 10 times .
