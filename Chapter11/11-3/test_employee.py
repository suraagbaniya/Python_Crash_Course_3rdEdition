"""
11-3. Employee: Write a class called Employee . The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes . Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount .
Write a test case for Employee . Write two test methods, test_give_ default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise() . Use the setUp() method so you don’t have to create a new employee instance in each test method . Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass .
