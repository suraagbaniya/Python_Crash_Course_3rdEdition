'''
8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a diction- ary . The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name . It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments . Call the func- tion with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature . Your function should work for a call like this one:
                  car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
Print the dictionary that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly .
