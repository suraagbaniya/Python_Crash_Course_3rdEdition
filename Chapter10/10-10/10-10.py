10-10. Common Words: Visit Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org/ ) and find a few texts you’d like to analyze . Download the text files for these works, or copy the raw text from your browser into a text file on your computer .
You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word or phrase appears in a string . For example, the following code counts the number of times 'row' appears in a string:
>>> line = "Row, row, row your boat" >>> line.count('row')
2
>>> line.lower().count('row')
3
Notice that converting the string to lowercase using lower() catches all appearances of the word you’re looking for, regardless of how it’s formatted .
Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and determines how many times the word 'the' appears in each text .
